## Infix tests
It might be useful to have an infix reader at hand, especially when writing large test sequeces.
It may also be helpful to some users.

In the first place we try the reliable one by Mark Kantrowitz. Another option is the infix reader contained in SNARK.

The file `ẁeyl-infix.lisp`is the original one slightly modified, that is `expt` has beeen interchanged with `logor` so that
entering `(+-> "p^q)"` in Weyl yields `(expt p q)`.
